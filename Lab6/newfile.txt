Panic! At The Disco - New Perspective
---

---

---
I feel the salty waves come in
---
I feel them crash against my skin
---
And I smile as I respire
---
Because I know they'll never win
---
There's a haze above my TV
---
That changes everything I see
---
And maybe if I continue watching
---
I'll lose the traits that worry me
---
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
---
Stop there, and let me correct it
---
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
---
You come along because I love your face
---
And I'll admire your expensive taste
---
And who cares? Divine intervention
---
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
---
But leaving now would be a good idea
---
So catch me up on getting out of here
---
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
---
Taking everything for granted
---
But we still respect the time
---
We move along with some new passion
---
Knowing everything is fine (everything is fine)
---
And I would wait and watch the hours
---
Fall in a hundred separate lines
---
But I regain repose
---
And wonder how I ended up inside (up inside)
---
Can we fast forward to go down on me?
---
Stop there, and let me correct it
---
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
---
You come along because I love your face
---
And I'll admire your expensive taste
---
And who cares? Divine intervention
---
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
---
But leaving now would be a good idea
---
So catch me up on getting out of here
---
Catch me up on getting out of here
---
More to the point, I need to show
---
How much I can come and go
---
Other plans fell through
---
And put a heavy load on you, I know
---
There's no more that need be said
---
When I'm inching through your bed
---
Take a look around instead and watch me go
---
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
---
Stop there, and let me correct it
---
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
---
You come along because I love your face
---
And I'll admire your expensive taste
---
And who cares? Divine intervention
---
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
---
But leaving now would be a good idea
---
So catch me up on getting out of here
---
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
---
Don't wanna live a life that is comprehensive
---
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
---
Now catch me up on getting out of here
---
So catch me up on getting out of here
---
Go, go, go down on me
---
Can we fast forward to go down...---
